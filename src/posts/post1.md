# Breathing is bi-directional 

Today is the day I decided to breath-out. \
\
23 years of age with filled lungs, ready to release some tension letting some out. I recently got into a state of pure inspiration, pure breathing-in, constantly looking for the next step to take. Albeit my buffer memory filled with next steps, I realised I aint’t taking any. \
\
Today I woke up at 5:30am, and on my way to work, still a bit unaware on where this 24h would have brought me, I had the previlege to have a chat with the one and only [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/). To be fair, it was more of a monologue, than a chat. I believe many have had such monologue from Derek in the past and many others will in the future. This morning Derek was very frank with me, he didn’t hesistate sharing, and many solid messages got past my critical firewall. 119 pages into the chat, Derek dropped the bomb. “You have to pause the input and focus on your output”, he said.\

Breathing is bi-directional. 
Breathing is so fundamental that we don’t even have to think about it, it just works. Every breath-in is followed by its complementary breath-out; so automatic. But what if we looked at this from a different perspective, and replaced “breathing-in” with consuming books, listening to podcasts, watching YouTube videos, or attending lectures instead? All these activities involve receiving something. Naturally following there should be the breathing out phase, the time to produce something, to give back what you received and elaborated upon, right? Well, yes, but no. Despite how easy it is to breath-in, to breath-out is much more demanding.\
\
I believe I have breathed-in for enough time now, so that my lungs need some rest; it’s time to breath-out. With this very short and simple post I don’t aim at nothing in particular, but to breat-out and do something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time: starting my own blog, or better, my thoughts archive. \
\
The hunting thoughts are many. From “okay, but what am I gonna write about”, passing by “what if it won’t be appreciated”, up to “who am I to ask people for their time”. All oppressive thoughts I put aside thinking that “public comments are just feedback on something I made” (thanks Derek), feedback to improve upon, not to be intended as directed to my persona.\
\
And that’s it. With this initial, short and timid breath-out, I intend to dedicate more of my breathing to the outer world, not limiting it to my personal inner discussion, but opening it to whomever interested.
